# Introduction

This document provides instructions on how to build CP2K 6.1 and its dependencies on ARCHER.

Further information on CP2K can be found at its [website](https://www.cp2k.org) and on the ARCHER [CP2K documentation page](http://www.archer.ac.uk/documentation/software/cp2k/).

We will build CP2K with the GNU compiler, with support for OpenMP.

## Dependencies
CP2K has the following dependencies (which are all available on ARCHER):
- Python
- Make
- C and Fortran compiler
- MPI
- BLAS, LAPACK and SCALAPACK

In addition to these dependencies, there are a number of optional libraries that can be used to improve the performance of CP2K. For this build of CP2K, we will build (where necessary) and incorporate the following libraries:
- FFTW (available as a module on ARCHER)
- ELPA
- libint
- libxc
- libxsmm
- plumed

# Downloading CP2K and basic setup
## Setup
First of all, we need to switch to the GNU compiler suite:

```
$ module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
```

At this point, it is also a good idea to load the fftw module:

```
$ module add cray-fftw
```

Finally we can set environment variables to tell `make` to use the compiler wrappers:

```
$ export FC=ftn CC=cc CXX=CC
```

## Download CP2K
We must choose a directory to build CP2K in. Typically this would be in `/work`. Say we have chosen to build it in `/work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K`. We `cd` to this directory, then download CP2K 6.1 using

```
$ svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cp2k/code/branches/cp2k-6_1-branch cp2k
```

We will now go on to download and build all of the third party libraries we will link to CP2K.

# Building third-party libraries
In the CP2K build directory, create a `libs` directory:

```
$ mkdir /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/libs
```

that we will install the libraries into. We can now proceed to build the libraries:

## ELPA
Download ELPA, extract the tarball and `cd` into the ELPA directory:

```
$ wget https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/html/Releases/2015.05.001/elpa-2015.05.001.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf elpa-2015.05.001.tar.gz
$ cd elpa-2015.05.001
```

Now run
```
$ ./configure --prefix=/work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/libs/elpa --enable-openmp --enable-shared=no
$ make
$ make install
$ export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=static
```

Note: if you encounter linking problems then use `export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic` and reissue the `make`
command (**without** `make clean`) remembering to issue the `export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=static` at the end of the build.

## libint
Download libint, extract the tarball and `cd` into the libint directory:
```
$ wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libint/v1-releases/libint-1.1.4.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf libint-1.1.4.tar.gz
$ cd libint-1.1.4
```
Now create a directory where the object files will be put, and build libint
```
$ mkdir obj
$ cd obj
$ ../configure --prefix=/work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/libs/libint
$ make
$ make install
```

## libxc
```
$ wget http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/down.php?file=libxc/4.2.3/libxc-4.2.3.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf libxc-4.2.3.tar.gz
$ cd libxc-4.2.3
$ ./configure --prefix=/work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/build/libs/libxc
$ make
$ make install
```

## libxsmm
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm.git
$ cd libxsmm
$ make INTRINSICS=1 PREFIX=/work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/build/libs/libxsmm install
```

## libgrid
This is not actually a third party library, but rather a component of CP2K itself. This step runs some autotuning to determine the optimum compile parameters for this component, and produces a static library `libgrid.a` containing the optimised routines.

To do this, we first compile the various different versions of test code, then run a job on ARCHER to determine the runtimes for each. Finally we build the library.

First `cd` into the `autotune_grid` directory in the CP2K source directory:
```
$ cd  /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/cp2k/cp2k/tools/autotune_grid
```

Next we want to extract the data files
```
$ tar -xzf data.tgz
```

We now edit `generate_makefile.sh`, changing the parts that say `./out_${l}_${iopt}/test.x` to `aprun -n 1 ./out_${l}_${iopt}/test.x` so that the script knows to use `aprun` to launch executables.

Now we build the executables
```
$ make all_gen
```

We now need to submit a job to benchmark the executables. To do this we use the following batch script, `submit_libgrid.pbs`:

```
#!/bin/bash --login

#PBS -N libgrid
#PBS -l select=1
#PBS -l walltime=24:00:00
#PBS -A z19-cse

export PBS_O_WORKDIR=$(readlink -f $PBS_O_WORKDIR)               

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

make all_run
```

This is now submitted to the queue (__remember to change the charging code to your own code__):
```
$ qsub submit_libgrid.pbs
```

NOTE: the job can take several hours to complete.

Now determine the optimum compile flags/options and create the static library:

```
$ make gen_best
$ make libgrid.a
```

Finally, create a directory for libgrid and copy the library into this directory

```
$ mkdir /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/build/libs/libgrid
$ cp libgrid.a /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/build/libs/libgrid/
```

## Plumed

Download plumed 2.3.6 from [here](http://www.plumed.org/get-it) and copy the tarball onto ARCHER. Once it is on ARCHER, extract the tarball, `cd` into the directory and build:

```
$ tar -xzf plumed-2.3.6.tgz
$ cd plumed-2.3.6
$ export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic
$ ./configure --prefix=/work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/build/libs/plumed
$ make
$ make install
```

# Building CP2K

We are now in a position where we can build CP2K. To do this we need an _arch_ file, which is used to set environment variables and compile options for the machine we are compiling CP2K on. We will use the file `ARCHER.psmp` as the _arch_ file. We wish to place this file in the `arch` directory in the CP2K source directory:

```
$ cp ARCHER.psmp /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/cp2k/cp2k/arch/
```

__IMPORTANT:__ You will need to edit the lines
```
DATA_DIR = /work/z01/z01/gpsgibb/CP2K/build/cp2k/cp2k/data
LIB_LOC  = /work/z01/z01/gpsgibb/CP2K/build/libs
```
to point to your CP2K directory.

We then move into the makefiles directory:
```
$ cd /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/cp2k/cp2k/makefiles/
```

And make CP2K with:
```
$ make -j4 ARCH=ARCHER VERSION=psmp cp2k
```

If successful, the CP2K executable `cp2k.psmp` should be located at `
 /work/[project]/[project]/[username]/CP2K/cp2k/cp2k/exe/ARCHER/cp2k.psmp
`
