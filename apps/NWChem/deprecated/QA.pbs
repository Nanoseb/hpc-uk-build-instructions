# WHY does NWChem need to specify the memory used?
#
# NWCHEM_MEMORY_TOTAL is 'memory per processor core'
# (https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/wiki/Memory), i.e. node memory
# / cores used per node.  Estimate the node memory from the MOM node
# (i.e. the first node in the job).
node_memory=$(awk '/MemTotal/{print $2*1024/8}' /proc/meminfo) # doubles

# Set the ppn used (and use it in the mpiexec_mpt command as the
# parameter for the -perhost (= -ppn = -grr) option).  Here it is set
# to 4, to match the number of processes used by NWChem (excluding the extra ARMCI-MPI process).

# Many tests have 'rounding' errors, some tests have old validation
# results that don't match newer versions of NWChem, some tests have
# too little memory specified in the input file, some tests give
# incorrect results, some tests fail and NWChem reports this, and some
# tests just fail!
