# One of OpenMP or MKL caused problems.  It could also be errors in
# the NWChem documentation (how to set 4-byte vs 8-byte integers).
# MKL OK, in future might put OpenMP back (only much use for Xeon Phi
# though)?

# These shouldn't be needed but the logic is swapped for Scalapack, so
# just be sure (errors in NWChem documentation?).
